        <h1>Re: Dover Cliff university application</h1>

        <p>Dear Dover,</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to
          study for your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your questions one
          by one, in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>
          We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any
          time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
          beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>First semester: 29 August 2019</li>
          <li>Second semester: 22 January 2020</li>
          <li>Third semester: 2 May 2020</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
          prefer.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

        <p>
          At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as
          long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information
          studies. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
          the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
          ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order
          of priority:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
            Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at
            temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size
            exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to
            3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for
            representing musical scores.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
          including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff
          and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
          Thanks.
        </p>

        <h2>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h2>

        <p>
          Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study
          animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as
          follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
          <dd>
            A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on
            seal.
          </dd>
          <dt>The elk</dt>
          <dd>
            An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous
            regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also
            frequently visits the Banff centre for the arts.
          </dd>
          <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
          <dd>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people
            believe eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on
            film. This cry is instead the call of the red-tail.
          </dd>
        </dl>
